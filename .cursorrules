Minimize file creation. Always update existing files first before creating new ones.

For BigQuery queries, always check estimated query cost and warn about high-cost queries (>10GB). Recommend dry-run validation for large datasets.

For BigQuery SQL, use DECLARE for configurable parameters, include proper timestamp filtering, and maintain consistency with existing query patterns in the repository.

When writing Python code for Google Cloud, use proper resource cleanup, context managers, error handling, and appropriate timeouts/retries.

For Jupyter notebooks, keep cells focused, include markdown documentation, and never hardcode credentials or sensitive data.
