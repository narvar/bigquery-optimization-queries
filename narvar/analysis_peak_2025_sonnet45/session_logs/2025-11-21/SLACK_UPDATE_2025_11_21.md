## Update: Platform Cost Finalized + Cost Optimization Strategy Refined

**✅ Julia Le Feedback - All Three Points Addressed:**

1. **Core returns analyzed:** $1,917/year (returns_etl pipeline to reporting.*) 
2. **Cold storage strategy:** Orders archive saves $7K-$10K/year, supports ML training
3. **Tiered batching:** Analyzed feasibility - recommend uniform 6-hr pilot first, add tiering if needed

**📊 Platform Cost Finalized:** **$261,591/year** (refined from $263,084)
- Returns breakdown: Shopify $8,461 + Core $1,917 = $10,378 total
- Cost per retailer: $921/year

**💡 Cost Optimization (Updated):**
- Cold storage (orders table): $7K-$10K/year ✅ Can start now
- Uniform batching: $10K-$15K/year ⏸️ Pilot first
- Tiered batching (Julia's proposal): $8K-$18K/year ⏸️ Requires Prasanth validation
- **Conservative total: $17K-$25K/year**

**🚀 NEXT:** Sample additional retailers, validate tiered batching with Prasanth
