## 🗂️ Why These Were Archived

**Reason**: Documentation evolved through Phase 1 development:

1. **Planning Phase** (Oct 31): PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, QUICKSTART.md
2. **Development Phase** (Nov 5 early): PERIOD_COVERAGE_PLAN.md
3. **Initial Results** (Nov 5 mid): PHASE1_IMPROVEMENTS.md, PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
4. **Final Results** (Nov 5 final): PHASE1_FINAL_REPORT.md ✅

The final report consolidates all learnings and actual results, making interim docs redundant for ongoing work.

**These archived docs remain useful for**:
- Understanding the development process
- Seeing how issues were discovered and fixed
- Historical reference for decision-making
- Audit trail for methodology evolution
